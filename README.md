# Lube-City-Sales-Growth

This project aims to estimate the organic growth rate in Lube City buisnesses for the 2020 fiscal year. It is part of the contract work I have done for the company through the University of Victoria Consulting Group. 

Lube City recently underwent an ad campaign aimed at increasing Tire sales in October 2021. They want to know what percentage of increased sales following the ad period was due to sales resulting from the ads and not organic growth. Therefore, we must caluclate the organic growth.

Organic growth rate is typically calculated by comparing revenues year over year. However, the problem within this project is that we only have data for an ~11month period prior to the ad campaign. This presents a problem as we cannot accurately determine organic growth in a highly seasonal business without at least 2 years worth of data.

Here, I present possible solutions by fitting different statistical models to their seasonal growth trajectories over the 2020 year. From these models, I derive revenue forecasts for the ad period of this business, allowing for the reasonable estimation of how effective the ad campaign was.
